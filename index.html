		<h1>The Long Absent Planeswalker</h1>
		<p>The Magic The Gathering page for players who have left the game, and come back. Whether you started in Beta or Ahmokhet it doesn't matter. What matters is you're back, and we are going to do our best to make you feel at home.</p>
		<p>MTG is one of those things that connects us without much need for much else. Regardless of your background, MTG is there and you are welcome at the table.</p>
		<p>At <a href="http://www.wizards.com">Wizards</a> you can learn the game's official rules and relatively up to date information. Though, you could just learn it here as well.</p>
		<p>Some things to consider when returning</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There may be new mechanics, but don't stress(they're usually easy)</li>
			<li>People usually leave because of their playgroup (finding a new one is easy)</li>
			<li>You don't need to memorize the new cards to start playing again</li>
			<li>It's a game to have fun with. </li>
		
		</ul>
